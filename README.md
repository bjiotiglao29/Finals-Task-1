## Final lab Task-1
Final Lab Task 1 - MySQL Basics
In this task, we used MySQL to create a functional database and learned how to properly write and execute the required SQL queries. We were tasked with creating multiple tables that represent a sample company, which were later linked through relationships.
These are the guide given by our instructor:

## Task 1: Create the employees table

Define employee_id as a unique integer, auto-increment, and primary key.
Define employee_name as a VARCHAR (up to 255 characters), and make it not null.
Define manager_id as an integer, which will be a foreign key referencing employee_id from the same table.

## Task 2: Create the departments table

Define department_id as a unique integer, auto-increment, and primary key.
Define department_name as a VARCHAR (up to 255 characters), and make it not null.

## Task 3: Create the employee_departments table

Define employee_id as an integer, which will be a foreign key referencing employee_id in the employees table.
Define department_id as an integer, which will be a foreign key referencing department_id in the departments table.
Set a composite primary key on the combination of employee_id and department_id.

## Task 4: Create the employee_projects table

Define employee_id as an integer, which will be a foreign key referencing employee_id in the employees table.
Define project_name as a VARCHAR (up to 255 characters), and make it not null.

## Task 5: Create the managers table

Define manager_id as a unique integer, auto-increment, and primary key.
Define employee_id as an integer, which will be a foreign key referencing employee_id in the employees table.
